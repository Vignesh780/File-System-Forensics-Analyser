CHRONOS is a Python-based file system forensics analyzer developed to examine
NTFS, FAT32, and EXT4 file systems through metadata extraction and disk
carving techniques. The tool enables investigators to analyze live systems for
hidden files and metadata, as well as perform raw disk recovery from forensic
images. It offers an interactive, menu-driven interface that allows users to select
different forensic operation modes based on investigation requirements.
CHRONOS extracts critical forensic artifacts such as timestamps, permissions, and
file attributes, and supports recovery of deleted data where possible. The project is
intended for students, cybersecurity professionals, and small organizations,
providing a practical and extensible platform for understanding real-world digital
forensics. The project aims to provide a beginner-friendly yet effective automation
tool that helps students, security analysts, and small organizations understand and
implement fundamental cybersecurity concepts through practical exposure and offering
multiple operational modes—Live Analysis, Raw Disk Recovery, and Full
Forensic Suite—CHRONOS provides flexibility for both learning and
investigative purposes. This project bridges the gap between theoretical file system
concepts and real-world forensic analysis
